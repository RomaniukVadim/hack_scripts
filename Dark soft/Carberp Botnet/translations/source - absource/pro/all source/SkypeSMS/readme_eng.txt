Send messages using the following command:
SkypeSms.exe +123456789 "Message"

if all went well you'll see 0 on the screen. Otherwise you'll see 1 and the description of the problem.
When the program is started Skype is requesting a confirmation to allow the program to use it. At the moment I don't know
how to get rid of it, need to play with Skype setting I think.
